Timezone Handling Report for Clinical Trial Data
-------------------------------------------------

1. Original Timezone
The patient vital signs dataset originally contained datetime values without any timezone 
information, meaning they were "naive" timestamps. Naive timestamps do not contain any 
offset information and do not indicate whether the recorded time corresponds to local 
time, UTC, or any other regional standard. In clinical settings, naive timestamps can lead 
to major inconsistencies when data are collected from multiple sites or during daylight 
saving time transitions.

2. Localization Method
The first step in making the dataset timezone-aware was to assign a baseline timezone. 
Consistent with best practices in medical informatics, we localized the datetime index to 
UTC using tz_localize('UTC'). This does not shift the timestamps; instead, it simply states 
that the naive timestamps should be interpreted as UTC. UTC is recommended because it has 
no daylight saving time adjustments, eliminating ambiguity.

3. Timezone Conversion
After localizing the data to UTC, we converted the timestamps to US/Eastern using 
tz_convert('US/Eastern'). This conversion correctly adjusts timestamps to reflect the local 
time of an East Coast clinical site, including daylight saving time transitions.

4. DST Handling
Using UTC as the baseline timezone prevents common ambiguity issues that arise during the 
start or end of daylight saving time. For example, the timestamp 2023-03-12 10:00:00+00:00 in UTC 
corresponds to 2023-03-12 06:00:00-04:00 in US/Eastern. While Eastern Time "jumps" forward during 
DST, UTC remains constant, ensuring correct time alignment across all patient records.

5. Example
UTC example: 2025-11-16 01:24:50.357221+00:00
Converted to Eastern: 2025-11-15 20:24:50.357221-05:00

Overall, storing data in UTC and converting to local time only when needed is the safest, 
most reproducible method for handling clinical time series data.
