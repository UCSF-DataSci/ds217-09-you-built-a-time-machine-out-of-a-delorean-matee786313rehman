MISSING DATA REPORT — TIME SERIES (Q2.4)

1. Missing Value Summary
The upsampled daily time series created from monthly temperature data contained a very high rate of missing values. 
After resampling from month-end data to daily frequency using `.resample('D').asfreq()`, the resulting series had 
323 missing values out of 335 total observations, which is approximately 
96.42% missing. This occurs because only 12 monthly values exist, 
and all non–month-end dates become NaN.

2. Missing Data Patterns
The missing data pattern is extremely structured and deterministic: missing values occur on every day except the last 
day of each month. The missing-by-month summary shows that longer months (e.g., January, March, July, August) contain 
more missing values simply because they have more non–month-end days. Similarly, the missing-by-weekday pattern shows 
that missing values are spread evenly across weekdays, reflecting the fact that missingness is generated by calendar 
structure rather than patient behavior or data collection issues. This pattern is typical of upsampling rather than 
real-world data gaps.

3. Imputation Method
I used several methods to explore different approaches to filling missing values: forward fill, backward fill, linear 
interpolation, time-based interpolation, and rolling-mean imputation. Of these, the rolling-mean imputation method 
produced the smoothest and most clinically meaningful trajectory, although it required an initial forward fill step to 
avoid propagating NaNs in long gaps.

4. Rationale
Forward fill is simple and preserves the last observed value, but it creates flat segments that may not reflect real 
physiology. Backward fill has the same issue. Linear interpolation works well for evenly spaced monthly data, but it may 
smooth too aggressively. Time-based interpolation is preferred in medical time series because it respects uneven temporal 
spacing. Rolling-mean imputation provides local smoothing and reduces noise, making it appropriate for clinical vital 
signs that tend to evolve gradually.

5. Pros and Cons
Advantages: Rolling mean reduces noise, avoids abrupt jumps, and produces realistic trends. Interpolation methods 
maintain continuity and avoid sudden step changes introduced by ffill/bfill.  
Limitations: Rolling windows require assumptions about local smoothness, and forward fill must be used first to anchor 
the window. Interpolation may produce unrealistic values if underlying dynamics are non-linear.

6. Example
Before imputation, January had NaNs on every day except 2023-01-31. After applying rolling-mean imputation, all missing 
values were filled, resulting in a continuous daily temperature series suitable for downstream analysis.
